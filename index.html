        <p>Hello! My name is Elvis Uchenna Uwakwe.I am from Ebonyi State, Nigeria. I have a strong passion for 
        singing and reading, both of which I enjoy as hobbies in myfree time. They help me stay creative and balanced. 
        Currently, I am studying Web Design and Development at Brigham Young University Idaho (BYUI).
        I am really excited about the field because it combines creativity and technical skills, and I love the idea of being
        able to build beautiful and functional websites from scratch! I look forward to learning more about coding, web design,
        and all the tools that help bring websites to life.üåê </p>
